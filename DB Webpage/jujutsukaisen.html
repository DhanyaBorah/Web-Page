            under the guidance of Satoru Gojo, a powerful and eccentric teacher. The school specializes in combating

            As Yuji learns about the dangers of curses and the existence of a powerful cursed object known as Sukuna's
            finger, he becomes intertwined with the legendary curse, Ryomen Sukuna. In a desperate attempt to save his
            friends, Yuji ingests one of Sukuna's fingers, becoming the host of the cursed spirit himself.

            Paintings, led by the enigmatic and ruthless Mahito. These encounters push Yuji and his friends to their
